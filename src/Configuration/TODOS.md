# TODOS 
- Review all properties from https://www.iana.org/assignments/oauth-parameters/oauth-parameters.xhtml#client-metadata
- Create a standalone host
- Create a console client
- Support custom properties, such as token lifetimes, the RequireClientSecret flag, etc
- Consider how the design will evolve to support DCM
- Create a sample that requires use of extensibility points to set client id and secret (scenario is a CI/CD pipeline needs to create the client)
